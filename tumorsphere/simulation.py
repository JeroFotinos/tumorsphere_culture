class Simulation:
    """Class for simulating multiple `Culture` objects with different
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first_cell_is_stem : bool, optional
        Whether the first cell of each `Culture` object should be a stem cell.
        If set to `False`, the first cell of the cultures will be a
        differentiated one. Default is `True` (because tumorspheres are CSC
        seeded cultures).
    prob_stem : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will self-replicate. Defaults to 0.36
        for being the value measured by BenÃ­tez et al. (BMC Cancer, (2021),
        1-11, 21(1))for the experiment of Wang et al. (Oncology Letters,
        (2016), 1355-1360, 12(2)) on a hard substrate.
    prob_diff : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will yield a differentiated cell and
        then lose its stemness, effectively yielding two differentiated cells.
        Defaults to 0 (because our intention was to see if percolation occurs,
        and if it doesn't happen at prob_diff = 0, it will never happen).
    num_of_realizations : int, optional
        Number of `Culture` objects to simulate for each combination of
        `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`. Default is `4`.
    num_of_steps_per_realization : int, optional
        Number of simulation steps (i.e., time steps) to perform for each
        `Culture` object. Default is `10`.
    rng_seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator used in the simulation. This is
        the seed on which every other seed depends. Default is the hexadecimal
        number (representing a 128-bit integer)
        `0x87351080E25CB0FAD77A44A3BE03B491`.
    cell_radius : int, optional
        Radius of the cells in the simulation. Default is `1`.
    adjacency_threshold : int, optional
        Distance threshold for two cells to be considered neighbors. Default
        is `4`, which is an upper bound to the second neighbor distance of
        approximately `2 * sqrt(2)` in a hexagonal close packing.
    cell_max_repro_attempts : int, optional
        Maximum number of attempts to create a new cell during the
        reproduction of an existing cell in a `Culture` object.
        Default is`1000`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    (All parameters, plus the following.)
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator`
        The random number generator used in the simulation to instatiate the
        generator of cultures and cells.
    cultures : dict
        Dictionary storing the `Culture` objects simulated by the `Simulation`.
        The keys are strings representing the combinations of `prob_stem` and
        `prob_diff` and the realization number.


    Methods:
    --------
    simulate_parallel()
        Runs the simulation persisting data to one file for each culture.
