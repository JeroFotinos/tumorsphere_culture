class Simulation:
    """
    Class for simulating multiple `Culture` objects with different parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first_cell_is_stem : bool, optional
        Whether the first cell of each `Culture` object should be a stem cell
        or a differentiated one. Default is `True` (because tumorspheres are
        CSC-seeded cultures).
    prob_stem : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will self-replicate. Defaults to 0.36
        for being the value measured by Ben√≠tez et al. (BMC Cancer, (2021),
        1-11, 21(1))for the experiment of Wang et al. (Oncology Letters,
        (2016), 1355-1360, 12(2)) on a hard substrate.
    prob_diff : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will yield a differentiated cell.
        Defaults to 0 (because the intention was to see if percolation occurs,
        and if it doesn't happen at prob_diff = 0, it will never happen).
    num_of_realizations : int, optional
        Number of `Culture` objects to simulate for each combination of
        `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`. Default is `10`.
    num_of_steps_per_realization : int, optional
        Number of simulation steps to perform for each `Culture` object.
        Default is `10`.
    rng_seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator used in the simulation. This is
        the seed on which every other seed depends. Default is the hexadecimal
        number (representing a 128-bit integer)
        `0x87351080E25CB0FAD77A44A3BE03B491`.
    cell_radius : int, optional
        Radius of the cells in the simulation. Default is `1`.
    adjacency_threshold : int, optional
        Distance threshold for two cells to be considered neighbors. Default
        is `4`, which is an upper bound to the second neighbor distance of
        approximately `2 * sqrt(2)` in a hexagonal close packing.
    cell_max_repro_attempts : int, optional
        Maximum number of attempts to create a new cell during the
        reproduction of an existing cell in a `Culture` object.
        Default is`1000`.
    continuous_graph_generation : bool, optional
        Whether to update the adjacency graph after each cell division, or to
        keep it empty until manual generation of the graph. Default is `False`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    (All parameters, plus the following.)
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator`
        The random number generator used in the simulation to instatiate the
        generator of cultures and cells.
    cultures : dict
        Dictionary storing the `Culture` objects simulated by the `Simulation`.
        The keys are strings representing the combinations of `prob_stem` and
        `prob_diff` and the realization number.
    data : dict
        Dictionary storing the simulation data for each `Culture` object
        simulated by the `Simulation`. The keys are strings representing
        the combinations of `prob_stem` and `prob_diff` and the realization
        number.
    average_data : dict
        Dictionary storing the average simulation data for each combination of
        `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`. The keys are strings representing the
        combinations of `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`.

    Methods:
    --------
    simulate()
        Runs the simulation persisting data to one file for each culture.
    simulate_parallel()
        Runs the simulation persisting data to one file for each culture.
    simulate_small()
        Runs the simulation saving data to a dictionary for interactive use.
    _average_of_data_ps_i_and_pd_k(i, k)
        Computes the average of the data for a given pair of probabilities
        `prob_stem[i]` and `prob_diff[k]`.

        Plot the average data for a given combination of self-replication
        and differentiation probabilities.
