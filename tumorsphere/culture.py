class Culture:
    """Class that represents a culture of cells.

    It contains methods to manipulate the cells and the graph representing
    the culture. The culture can be visualized using the provided plotting
    methods.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency_threshold : float, optional
        The maximum distance between two cells for them to be considered
        neighbors. Default is 4, which is an upper bound to 2 * sqrt(2)
        (the second neighbor distance in a hexagonal close-packed lattice,
        which is the high density limit case).
    cell_radius : float, optional
        The radius of the cells in the culture. Default is 1.
    cell_max_repro_attempts : int, optional
        The maximum number of attempts that a cell will make to reproduce before
        giving up, setting it available_space attribute to false, and removing
        itself from the list of active cells. Default is 1000.
    first_cell_is_stem : bool, optional
        Whether the first cell in the culture is a stem cell. Default is False.
    prob_stem : float, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will self-replicate. Defaults to 0.36
        for being the value measured by Ben√≠tez et al. (BMC Cancer, (2021),
        1-11, 21(1))for the experiment of Wang et al. (Oncology Letters,
        (2016), 1355-1360, 12(2)) on a hard substrate.
    prob_diff : float, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will yield a differentiated cell.
        Defaults to 0 (because the intention was to see if percolation occurs,
        and if it doesn't happen at prob_diff = 0, it will never happen).
    continuous_graph_generation : bool, optional
        Whether the graph representing the culture should be continuously updated
        as cells are added. Default is False.
    rng_seed : int, optional
        The seed to be used by the culture's random number generator. Default is
        110293658491283598. Nevertheless, this should be managed by the
        Simulation object.

    Attributes
    ----------
    (All parameters, plus the following.)
    rng : numpy.random.Generator
        The culture's random number generator.
    cells : list of Cell
        The list of all cells in the culture.
    active_cells : list of Cell
        The list of all active cells in the culture, i.e., cells that still
        have its available_space attribute set to True and can still reproduce.
    graph : networkx.Graph
        The graph representing the culture. Nodes are cells and edges represent
        the adjacency relationship between cells.

    Methods
    -------
    plot_culture_dots()
        Plot the cells in the culture as dots in a 3D scatter plot.
    plot_culture_spheres()
        Plot the cells in the culture as spheres in a 3D scatter plot.
    plot_culture_fig()
        Plot the cells in the culture as spheres in a 3D scatter plot and
        return the figure object.
    plot_graph(self)
        Plot the cell graph using networkx.
    generate_adjacency_graph_from_scratch()
        Re-generates the culture graph containing cells and their neighbors
        using NetworkX.
    simulate(num_times)
        Simulates cell reproduction for a given number of time steps.
    any_csc_in_culture_boundary()
        Check if there is any cancer stem cell (CSC) in the boundary of the
        culture.
    simulate_with_data(num_times)
        Simulate culture growth for a specified number of time steps and
        record the data at each time step.
