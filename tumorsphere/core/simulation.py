class Simulation:
    """Class for simulating multiple `Culture` objects with different
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first_cell_is_stem : bool, optional
        Whether the first cell of each `Culture` object should be a stem cell.
        If set to `False`, the first cell of the cultures will be a
        differentiated one. Default is `True` (because tumorspheres are CSC
        seeded cultures).
    prob_stem : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will self-replicate. Defaults to 0.36
        for being the value measured by BenÃ­tez et al. (BMC Cancer, (2021),
        1-11, 21(1))for the experiment of Wang et al. (Oncology Letters,
        (2016), 1355-1360, 12(2)) on a hard substrate.
    prob_diff : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will yield a differentiated cell and
        then lose its stemness, effectively yielding two differentiated cells.
        Defaults to 0 (because our intention was to see if percolation occurs,
        and if it doesn't happen at prob_diff = 0, it will never happen).
    num_of_realizations : int, optional
        Number of `Culture` objects to simulate for each combination of
        `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`. Default is `4`.
    num_of_steps_per_realization : int, optional
        Number of simulation steps (i.e., time steps) to perform for each
        `Culture` object. Default is `10`.
    rng_seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator used in the simulation. This is
        the seed on which every other seed depends. Default is the hexadecimal
        number (representing a 128-bit integer)
        `0x87351080E25CB0FAD77A44A3BE03B491`.
    cell_radius : int, optional
        Radius of the cells in the simulation. Default is `1`.
    adjacency_threshold : int, optional
        Distance threshold for two cells to be considered neighbors. Default
        is `4`, which is an upper bound to the second neighbor distance of
        approximately `2 * sqrt(2)` in a hexagonal close packing.
    cell_max_repro_attempts : int, optional
        Maximum number of attempts to create a new cell during the
        reproduction of an existing cell in a `Culture` object.
        Default is`1000`.
    number_of_cells : int, optional
        The number of cells in the culture.
    side : float, optional
        The length of the side of the square where the cells move.
    density : float
        The density of the cells in the culture.
    reproduction : bool
        Whether the cells reproduces or not
    movement : bool
        Whether the cells moves or not

    Attributes
    ----------
    (All parameters, plus the following.)
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator`
        The random number generator used in the simulation to instatiate the
        generator of cultures and cells.
    cultures : dict
        Dictionary storing the `Culture` objects simulated by the `Simulation`.
        The keys are strings representing the combinations of `prob_stem` and
        `prob_diff` and the realization number.


    Methods:
    --------
    simulate_parallel()
        Runs the simulation persisting data to one file for each culture.

        A tuple containing the indices for the self-replication probability,

    Notes
    -----
    Due to the way multiprocessing works in Python, you can't directly use
    instance methods as workers for multiprocessing. The multiprocessing
    module needs to be able to pickle the target function, and instance
    methods can't be pickled. Therefore, the instance method worker had to be
    refactored to a standalone function (or a static method).
