class Simulation:
    """Class for simulating multiple `Culture` objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    first_cell_is_stem : bool, optional
        Whether the first cell of each `Culture` object should be a stem cell.
        If set to `False`, the first cell of the cultures will be a
        differentiated one. Default is `True` (because tumorspheres are CSC
        seeded cultures).
    prob_stem : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will self-replicate. Defaults to 0.36
        for being the value measured by BenÃ­tez et al. (BMC Cancer, (2021),
        1-11, 21(1))for the experiment of Wang et al. (Oncology Letters,
        (2016), 1355-1360, 12(2)) on a hard substrate.
    prob_diff : list of floats, optional
        The probability that a stem cell will yield a differentiated cell and
        then lose its stemness, effectively yielding two differentiated cells.
        Defaults to 0 (because our intention was to see if percolation occurs,
        and if it doesn't happen at prob_diff = 0, it will never happen).
    num_of_realizations : int, optional
        Number of `Culture` objects to simulate for each combination of
        `prob_stem` and `prob_diff`. Default is `4`.
    num_of_steps_per_realization : int, optional
        Number of simulation steps (i.e., time steps) to perform for each
        `Culture` object. Default is `10`.
    rng_seed : int, optional
        Seed for the random number generator used in the simulation. This is
        the seed on which every other seed depends. Default is the hexadecimal
        number (representing a 128-bit integer)
        `0x87351080E25CB0FAD77A44A3BE03B491`.
    cell_radius : int, optional
        Radius of the cells in the simulation. Default is `1`.
    adjacency_threshold : int, optional
        Distance threshold for two cells to be considered neighbors. Default
        is `4`, which is an upper bound to the second neighbor distance of
        approximately `2 * sqrt(2)` in a hexagonal close packing.
    cell_max_repro_attempts : int, optional
        Maximum number of attempts to create a new cell during the
        reproduction of an existing cell in a `Culture` object.
        Default is`1000`.
    initial_number_of_cells : int, optional
        The number of cells in the culture. If None, we start with a single
        cell.
    initial_density : float
        The initial density of the cells in the culture. None by default. If
        specified, it overrides the `culture_bounds` parameter to adjust the
        for the requested density.
    reproduction : bool
        Whether the cells reproduces or not
    movement : bool
        Whether the cells moves or not
    culture_bounds : int, optional
        The bounds of the grid, by default None. If None, the space is
        unbouded. If provided, the space is bounded to the
        [0, culture_bounds)^3 cube.
    grid_cube_size : int, optional
        The size of the cubes in the grid, by default 2. This value comes
        from considering that cells have usually radius 1, so a cube of
        side $h=2r$ is enough to make sure that we only have to check
        superpositions with cells on the same or first neighboring grid
        cells. Enlarge if using larger cells.
        For simulations with eliptical cells, use $h=2r_{max}$.
    grid_torus : bool, optional
        Whether the grid is a torus or not, only relevant when bounds are
        provided, True by default. If True, the grid is a torus, so the
        cells that go out of the bounds appear on the other side of the
        grid. If False, the grid is a bounded cube, so behavior should be
        defined to manage what happens when cells go out of the bounds of
        the simulation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    (All parameters, plus the following.)
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator`
        The random number generator used in the simulation to instatiate the
        generator of cultures and cells.
    cultures : dict
        Dictionary storing the `Culture` objects simulated by the `Simulation`.
        The keys are strings representing the combinations of `prob_stem` and
        `prob_diff` and the realization number.


    Methods
    -------
    simulate_parallel()
        Runs the simulation persisting data to one file for each culture.
